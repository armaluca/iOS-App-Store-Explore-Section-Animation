# App Store - Explore Section Animation (Swift)
Simple Test to replicate the slick "expanding &amp; collapse" tableview animations in section "Explore" of the App store.
You can of course reuse some of this in your projects.

I was really surprised when, by chance, I discovered these nice animations Apple playied with! I was curious to know the way they decided to go to develop something like this.
Still I am very curious cause I suppose must be many ways to achieve the same effect!
Hopefully you like it!
